    <h2>Tracy Freeman</h2>
    <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Tracy Freeman. This is a picture of my husband and I. We recently attented the Feather River Temple open house in Yuba City, CA. The grounds have beautiful 100 year old olive trees that were transplanted on the grounds. </p>
    <p>I've always wanted to get my degree so I started back to school through the Pathway program a couple years ago. Initally I thought I'd do Applied Technology since I've worked in the IT industry for the last 27 years, but that will likely change. I've always enjoyed working with computers and learning new things. My husband is excited I'm taking this course. He's hoping I'll be able to build him an updated website to showcase his music. I love that he has so much confidence and optimism in me learning new skills! I always say he's by biggest cheerleader. </p>     
    <p>We have been married for 19 years. We have three children from his prior marriage. They have blessed us with 13 grandchildren. </p>
    <p>I currently work full time as a site reliability engineer. I've been fortunate to have had good mentors who've helped me learn and grow which has allowed me to promote within the company I work for. </p>
    <p>I'm looking forward to learning with and from each of you as we navigate through the next 14 weeks in this class!</p>
