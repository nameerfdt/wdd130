      <h1>Kyle Freeman</h1>
      <p>
        I have always had a love of music. My first instrument was cello in the fourth grade; followed by piano in fifth and six grade; and then on to alto sax for 6 years in junior high and high school. I bought my first acoustic guitar with my first income tax return…a Yamaha FG-200.
      </p>
      <p>  
        Since I’m a self-taught guitar player, I would listen to a lot of songs during my high school years, trying to figure out certain song progressions. I learned a lot of the popular songs from groups such as Led Zeppelin; Loggins and Messina; Doobie Brothers; Crosby, Stills & Nash; Emerson, Lake and Palmer….and from anyone who wanted to get together and “jam.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not consider myself a good guitar player by any stretch of the imagination…but I have been blessed with some musical talent, and can pick-up most tunes by ear. I always sat first chair with cello and sax, even though I hardly ever brought my instruments home to practice. My relatives tell me my musical talent comes from my grandfather, Erastus Freeman, from my dad’s side of the family. They say he could pick-up just about any instrument and play it. I don’t remember him playing because he passed away when I was around two years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I’ve taught myself how to play, I have some unusual playing habits. I don’t finger some of the chords in the “traditional manner,” like D for example. I’ve been told that my picking patterns are sometimes “un-orthodox” because I only use two fingers to pick most of my songs (the thumb and index finger).
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t really start progressing in my playing ability until years later when technology came out with a device called a looping machine. It’s been one of the best investments I’ve ever made. A looping machine allows you to play back whatever you’ve composed on the fly. My wife, Tracy, and my kids (Natalie, Brittany and Blake) encouraged me to start recording all of my songs that I had composed over the years for others to enjoy. One thing led to another, and after a lot of reading and researching (and input from my son Blake), I put together a decent recording system to do all of my composing and editing by myself at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        When composing songs, I find that augmented/minor chords and fingerings are much more interesting to listen to than the traditional major chords and strumming. I tend to go off in that direction in 90% of my songs. My earlier songs are shorter in duration, but are more upbeat in general than my newer songs. The reason why my newer music is slower, more methodical is due to an opportunity I had to compose three songs for a movie producer by the name of Rory Walsh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rory heard my first cd, Acoustic, and liked it, so he contacted me asking if I had anything “dark & dreary” for an upcoming movie called Lesser Miracles. I told him I didn’t have anything currently recorded, but I could compose something for his movie. It took me two months to compose, record, edit, and ship three new songs to him….which are on my second album labeled “My Gift to You.” The song titles are: Lonely Thoughts; If Only I Could Have; and What Do You Know About Me? These three songs influenced my music composition into a new direction. My newer music tends to be slower flowing and more relaxing in style. Overall, I would classify my music into the categories of: contemporary, instrumental, new age, spa, or easy listening.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a final note, my family and friends are very important to me. As a tribute to them, when each grandchild approaches two years of age, and I’ve gotten to know their little quirks, individual personalities and demeanors, I compose their own special song that best suits or depicts their personality. As of this writing, I have seven grandkids and have completed four songs to date…two on the first album (“A Little Funk with Harrison” & “Ali-Pop”), and two on the second album (“Ellis with An Attitude” & “Attix’s Safari”).
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you find my music interesting and pleasing. Thank you for your time in viewing my website and listening to my music.
      </p>

        Sincerely,
      </p>

      <h2>Jessie’s Song</h2>
      <p>
        Our beloved Australian shepherd “Jessie” passed away at 8:00am on Christmas morning in 1998. We had family showing up at 9:00am for our Christmas morning festivities, so it was pretty hard on everyone that morning when they found out she had just passed away. As a result, I felt that I needed to compose a song for her because of the impact she had on the family…
      </p>
      <p>
        On a more positive note, I performed this song in front of roughly 2,000 people in the Community Center in downtown Sacramento for our company Christmas party in 1999. When the M.C. introduced me and gave a brief overview of the song that I was about to play, the audience thought the M.C. said “my daughter passed away Christmas morning” vs. my “my dog passed away Christmas morning.” I remember hearing a couple of sniffles in the audience as I finished the performance and thought it was odd that people would be that moved over my dog passing. Then someone came up to me and said they were so sorry to hear about my daughter’s passing, to which I had to chuckle and tell them it was my dog that passed away….not my daughter. They were much relieved and said they couldn’t wait to get back to their table and tell them the “real story.”

      <h2>Beautifully Haunting My Love</h2>

      <p>
        This song was composed for my wife Tracy in the fall of 2003. We were at a church event that evening, and as I was helping to put things away, I looked over towards her direction and saw her standing with her back to the wall, and her head looking slightly up, like she was pondering something in a far off distance. It reminded me of an old movie where you see someone you desire, but can’t be with them at that moment…like an old Humphrey Bogart film.

      <h2>Serenity</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first attempt in creating a song with the Boss looping machine. I wanted to create something cool, with lots of layers. It was a little ambitious for my first try, but it worked out really well in the end. First, I lay down a harmonic pattern for two measures; followed by some background bass notes; and then some soft minor chords to round out the background accompaniment. I’m then able to play my lead melody over the top of it. The overall effect is a cool, relaxing piece that makes you want to daydream the day away….

      <h2>Reflections With Dad</h2>
      <p>
        When my father was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2008, they couldn’t do anything for him, and sent him home for his final days. On one of my many visits to see Dad at the house that we all grew-up in as kids, I brought my Breedlove guitar along to play some quiet background music for him to relax too. What was interesting is that I came up with the whole completed accompaniment on the first pass of playing…which I’ve never done before with any of my song. When I finished playing this “new” song, Dad looked over and said “that was beautiful son.”  After Dad’s passing a month later, I added the melody part to the song to give it more feeling and closure. Every time I hear this song, I reflect back on all my life long experiences with Dad….

      <h2>A Little Funk with Harrison</h2>
      <p>
        My daughter Natalie brought Harrison over when he was around 6 months old, so that I could babysit him while she tested some students that Saturday morning. After she dropped him off, I carried Harrison into the office where I have my guitar equipment set-up. I left him in his car seat so that he could be comfortable while I practiced a couple of songs. When I first started playing through my Bose system, he was really alert, looking all around trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. I thought I would pick-up the pace and play some ‘60’s groves to see what his reaction would be. The minute I started playing some rock and roll stuff, Harrison started kicking his arms and legs like a “funky chicken” in excitement. Hence the playing style and name of his song “A Little Funk with Harrison.” Harrison is my second oldest grandchild.
      </p>

      <h2>Ali-Pop</h2>
      <p>
        Alexa is my oldest grandchild, who, like her mother Brittany, is quite the character. When I would observe Alexa in her first two years of life, I always thought of how my kids were at that age… bounding off in different directions, full of energy, and looking at life with a quizzical mind. The other thing that I noticed with Alexa is how kids of that age would have major peaks and valleys of energy levels, which would fluctuate dramatically throughout they’re day. With that in mind, this tune “Ali-Pop” depicts Alexa’s energy level throughout her day as one minute she’s riding high on energy, and the next moment she’s ready for a nap…with these cycles happening several times a day.

      <h3>GUITARS & EQUIPMENT</h3>
      
      <h2>McPherson Guitar</h2>

This guitar is built like a battle ax…with very warm sounding tones and great sustains.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Breedlove C12/MP</h2>
      <p>
        Breedlove C12/MP acoustic/electric; Beautiful Quilted Maple back and sides, with Cedar Top.  The guitar was built by Steve Henderson.    Electronics are Fishman Eclipse Blended mic/pickup, and Grover tuners.  It’s a very light feeling guitar, that has great high end delivery.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Equipment Used for Performing and Recording</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Boss RC-20/XL Phase Recorder….aka a Looper.</li>
        <li>Yamaha Magicstomp Acoustic</li> 
        <li>Line 6 -DL4 Delay Modeler</li>
        <li>Performing: Bose System 2</li> 
        <li>Recording: Apogee Duet interface</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over the years, I have found it difficult to find people to play guitar with…and those that I do meet with would rather sit and listen to what I’ve come-up with, rather than exchanging ideas and/or chord progressions. So, for those of you looking to progress in your playing style, do yourself a big favor and buy yourself a looping machine. I play about 80% of my songs using loops that I create on the fly when I practice or perform….nothing pre-recorded. It’s a great tool because it helps you hear your song you’ve created from a different perspective; perfects your foot timing when stomping on the box to repeat your loops; and it shows flaws & timing issues.  
      </p>
      <p>And as you create new songs, you’ll be able check for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does the song flow the way you intended it to?</li>
        <li>Does the song play too slow or fast for the mood you’re trying to create?</li>
        <li>Are the overlays and timings right?</li>
        <li>Are there notes that tend to clash with each other, rather than making it an interesting piece?</li>
      </ul>
      <p> 
        I happen to use the Boss RC-20XL for live playing and recording. I do have the Boss RC-50, which gives you a lot of options while performing, but, be aware that the first iteration of the first loop will have a slight dead pause at the beginning of the first loop back. After the first iteration of the loop plays through, the pause is gone for the rest of the playing time for that particular song. This is very frustrating when playing a live performance. The only way to minimize the pause duration with the RC-50 is to give priority to “audio” vs. “rhythm.” Unfortunately, you’ll only find one line in the last paragraph in the back of the instruction booklet that gives you this little bit of information.
