                    I have always had a love of music. My first instrument was cello in the fourth grade; followed by piano in fifth and six grade; and then on to alto sax for 6 years in junior high and high school. I bought my first acoustic guitar with my first income tax return…a Yamaha FG-200.

                    Since I’m a self-taught guitar player, I would listen to a lot of songs during my high school years, trying to figure out certain song progressions. I learned a lot of the popular songs from groups such as Led Zeppelin; Loggins and Messina; Doobie Brothers; Crosby, Stills & Nash; Emerson, Lake and Palmer….and from anyone who wanted to get together and “jam.”

                    <p>
                    I do not consider myself a good guitar player by any stretch of the imagination…but I have been blessed with some musical talent, and can pick-up most tunes by ear. I always sat first chair with cello and sax, even though I hardly ever brought my instruments home to practice. My relatives tell me my musical talent comes from my grandfather, Erastus Freeman, from my dad’s side of the family. They say he could pick-up just about any instrument and play it. I don’t remember him playing because he passed away when I was around two years of age.

                    Since I’ve taught myself how to play, I have some unusual playing habits. I don’t finger some of the chords in the “traditional manner,” like D for example. I’ve been told that my picking patterns are sometimes “un-orthodox” because I only use two fingers to pick most of my songs (the thumb and index finger).

                    <p>
                    I didn’t really start progressing in my playing ability until years later when technology came out with a device called a looping machine. It’s been one of the best investments I’ve ever made. A looping machine allows you to play back whatever you’ve composed on the fly. My wife, Tracy, and my kids (Natalie, Brittany and Blake) encouraged me to start recording all of my songs that I had composed over the years for others to enjoy. One thing led to another, and after a lot of reading and researching (and input from my son Blake), I put together a decent recording system to do all of my composing and editing by myself at home.

                    When composing songs, I find that augmented/minor chords and fingerings are much more interesting to listen to than the traditional major chords and strumming. I tend to go off in that direction in 90% of my songs. My earlier songs are shorter in duration, but are more upbeat in general than my newer songs. The reason why my newer music is slower, more methodical is due to an opportunity I had to compose three songs for a movie producer by the name of Rory Walsh.

                    <p>
                    Rory heard my first cd, Acoustic, and liked it, so he contacted me asking if I had anything “dark & dreary” for an upcoming movie called Lesser Miracles. I told him I didn’t have anything currently recorded, but I could compose something for his movie. It took me two months to compose, record, edit, and ship three new songs to him….which are on my second album labeled “My Gift to You.” The song titles are: Lonely Thoughts; If Only I Could Have; and What Do You Know About Me? These three songs influenced my music composition into a new direction. My newer music tends to be slower flowing and more relaxing in style. Overall, I would classify my music into the categories of: contemporary, instrumental, new age, spa, or easy listening.

                    On a final note, my family and friends are very important to me. As a tribute to them, when each grandchild approaches two years of age, and I’ve gotten to know their little quirks, individual personalities and demeanors, I compose their own special song that best suits or depicts their personality. As of this writing, I have seven grandkids and have completed four songs to date…two on the first album (“A Little Funk with Harrison” & “Ali-Pop”), and two on the second album (“Ellis with An Attitude” & “Attix’s Safari”).
